Math Functions for C++

```
git clone https://github.com/Jamlee977/Math
```

You don't need to call a namespace anymore, nor creating an object.

Put it in any folder that you want and call the header file.

To start using it, do:

```cpp
Math.(theMethodsYouWant);
```

Use

```cpp
Math.STRING.(To get some string methods)
```
